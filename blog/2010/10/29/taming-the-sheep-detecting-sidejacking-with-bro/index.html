<p><strong>Update</strong> (<em>June 22, 2011</em>):
You might also want to read the follow-up article about <a href="/blog/2011/06/better-nids-performance-by-tracking-roaming-users/">reducing false
positives by incorporating ARP
traffic</a>.</p>

<p>The Firefox extension <a href="http://codebutler.com/firesheep">Firesheep</a> brings
<a href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2007/08/sidejacking-with-hamster_05.html">sidejacking</a> (or <a href="http://fscked.org/projects/cookiemonster">cookie hijacking</a>) to the masses.
Its convenient point-and-click interface allows even unskilled users to hijack
their friendâ€™s Facebook and Twitter accounts from a public wireless network,
such as a coffee shop or at the airport.</p>

<p>This is a relevant issue because most popular Web 2.0 services only use TLS for
the initial authentication and then drop back to unencrypted HTTP throughout
the rest of communication. As a consequence, the session cookies fly around in
clear text and are easily captured.</p>

<h2 id="detection">Detection</h2>

<p>As network operators and security analysts, we would like to know when session
hijacking occurs. In the following, I present the design and implementation of
a sidejacking detector that I wrote for the <a href="http://www.bro-ids.org">Bro</a>
intrusion detection system.</p>

<h3 id="design-considerations">Design Considerations</h3>

<p>The detection strategy depends on the network topology and available context.
One problem is how to define a user. In flat IP address space, it makes sense
to identify a user by its IP address, but this would fail in a NAT environment,
where a single IP accomodates several users. For NAT scenarios, one could
define a user as a pair of IP address and <code>User-Agent</code> header. For large
NATs or NATs with identically configured machines, this latter notion of user
could be prone to false positivies, but this trade-off has to be faced.
Therefore, the notion of what constitutes a user can be configured in the
detector.</p>

<p>Another issue poses the presence of absence of DHCP context. Consider a hotspot
or coffeeshop network operator with a private IP space. If Bro can see DHCP
traffic, we can crisply identify a user by its MAC address and do not have
to resort to high-level notions, such as provided by HTTP headers. In a static
setup, however, this context will likely not be available. At the same time,
if a different address reuses a session cookie in a static IP topology, we
probably observed a sidejacking attack. Furthermore, if the same address uses
the same sesssion cookie from a different user agent, we report such activity.</p>

<p>There is another subtlety: the cookie header consists of a list of key-value
pairs, yet only a subset of those represent a user session while the others
could be random. Simply comparing the entire cookie string against a value seen
in the past would thus be prone to false negatives. Hence we have to restrict
ourselves to the relevant session-identifying subset. In fact, this is how
Firesheeps works: it ships with site-specific handlers that define the cookie
keys to extract and then sets only those to impersonate a user. This motivates
the following design: if a specification for a particular service is available,
restrict the cookie to the relevant fields, and otherwise use the cookie as a
whole. The default set of known services that ships with the detector is based
on all handlers Firesheep currently implements.</p>

<h3 id="decision-trees">Decision Trees</h3>

<p>Given these considerations, how should the detector operate? Clearly, we need a
flexible mechanism that can be configured to meet the specific conditions.
Let us distinguish the two notions of users. If we have the opaque NAT setting,
the detector operats according to the Figure below.</p>

<p><img src="user_id.png" alt="User identification purely based on IP address" class="float-center" /></p>

<p>Updating the cookie context is not really an actionable item but means that the
per-cookie state (such as when it was last seen) is being updated. In
comparsion, the decision tree for a flat address space looks a little more
elaborate.</p>

<p><img src="user_id_ext.png" alt="User identification based on IP address, User-Agent, and available DHCP
context" class="float-center" /></p>

<p>Note that session cookie reuse is only reported when the user is defined as IP
address.</p>

<h3 id="operation">Operation</h3>

<p>Simply using the sidejacking detector is straight-forward and does not require
detailed knowledge of Bro. Since it is implemented as a Bro script, running it
only requires passing the filename of the script on the command line:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">&gt; bro -i eth0 sidejack&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>When Bro detects session hijacking, it will report a <code>Sidejacking</code> notice:</p>

<p><code>TIMESTAMP Sidejacking ATTACKER ADDRESS (ATTACKER HTTP SESSION ID) @ 'ATTACKER&#x000A;USER_AGENT' hijacked SERVICE session (VICTIM HTTP SESSION) of VICTIM ADDRESS @&#x000A;'VICTIM USER AGENT' last seen at SESSION COOKIE LAST SEEN via cookie SESSION&#x000A;COOKIE</code></p>

<p>Similarly, session cookie reuse is reported as <code>SessionCookieReuse</code> and
has the following format:</p>

<p><code>ATTACKER ADDRESS (ATTACKER HTTP SESSION ID) reused SERVICE session VICTIM&#x000A;SESSION ID in user agent 'ATTACKER USER AGENT', where previous user agent was&#x000A;'VICTIM USER AGENT' and last seen at SESSION COOKIE LAST SEEN via cookie&#x000A;SESSION COOKIE</code></p>

<p>Extending the detector with a new site profile is also not too complicated. I
would recommend to write a new Bro script and leaves the original one
unmodified. Similar to writing a new Firesheep handler, a corresponding
detector for a fictive service Foo at foo.com where a user session comprises
the two cookies <code>session_id</code> and <code>auth_token</code> would look as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bro">@load sidejack&#x000A;&#x000A;redef HTTP::cookie_list +=&#x000A;{&#x000A;    ["Foo"] = [$url=/foo.com/, $keys=set("session_id", "auth_token")]&#x000A;};&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>If the cookie keys are dynamically generated, as it is the case with Wordpress,
one can also specify a regular expression instead:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bro">redef HTTP::cookie_list +=&#x000A;{&#x000A;    ["Foo"] = [$url=/foo.com/, $pat=/session_[0-9A-F]+/]&#x000A;};&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Telling the detector to use DHCP involves mereley flipping a switch:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bro">redef HTTP::use_dhcp_aliases = T;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, changing the notion of a user to include the user agent:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bro">redef HTTP::user_is_ip = F;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>To extend the analysis to all cookies and not only the listed known service
profiles:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bro">redef HTTP::known_services_only = F;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>Finally, it is possible to tweak the cookie expiration interval, i.e., the time
how long Bro remembers a cookie session. The example below tells Bro to keep
cookies for 10 minutes only.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bro">redef HTTP::cookie_expiration = 10 min;&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>If an attacker uses the cookie after the expiration interval, Bro will not
detect it. Naturally, there is a trade-off between accumulating state in memory
and opportunity for evasion.</p>

<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>

<p>By weaponizing the general public, Firesheep will hopefully push vendors to
switch TLS-only deployments more rapidly. During this painful migration period,
techniques like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_Transport_Security">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a> (HSTS) could prove
useful. A HSTS-enabled server sends a <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header to
the client that specifies a time period during which the client should use
encryption only. That is, the server upgrades the connection if the client
tries to use unencrypted HTTP.</p>

<h2 id="bro-code">Bro Code</h2>

<p>Practical security is all about raising the bar. Hopefully this detector allows
network operators to pinpoint the use of sidejacking attacks, such as
facilitated by Firesheep, and take accountable action. The detector is part of
<a href="http://git.bro-ids.org/bro-scripts.git">Bro script repository</a>
which we created as an official place for user-contributed scripts. The latest
version of the script can be <a href="http://git.bro-ids.org/bro-scripts.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/sidejack.bro">downloaded here</a>.</p>
