California makes data breach reports transparent to the public, thanks to
excellent laws:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>California law requires a business or state agency to notify any California
resident whose unencrypted personal information, as defined, was acquired, or
reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If an organization loses unencrypted personal identifiable information (PII),
they must notify the involved people. The Department of Justice maintains a
<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/ecrime/databreach/list">list of all data breaches</a> since January 2012. In this article, I
am taking a look at what we can learn from this data set.</p>

<h2 id="data-set">Data Set</h2>

<p>As of this writing, the list consists of 740 entries. Each row represents
one or more reported data breaches of a single organization and includes the
date of the breach and when it was reported. If we consider all breaches, we
arrive at a total of 899. A total of 183 (20%) breaches have an unknown breach
date.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>Given this data set, I am trying to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What does the distribution of breaches and reports look like?</li>
  <li>Which organizations have been breached most?</li>
  <li>What can we tell about <em>responsiveness</em>, i.e., the time from breach to
disclosure?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="breach-distribution">Breach Distribution</h3>

<p>First, let us get a high-level idea of the data. The plot below shows the
cumulative number of breach reports over time.</p>

<p><img src="breaches-cumulative-reported.png" alt="Cumulative reports" /></p>

<p>We observe a steady and linear increase over time. The next plot shows the
number of breaches and reports by year.</p>

<p><img src="breaches-by-year.png" alt="Breaches and reports by year" /></p>

<p>2014 had the most breaches, while 2015 the most reports. From 2012 to 2015, we
have a mean of 168 breaches per year. There is a natural lag in this data, from
the time to breach until report, as we see later when assessing responsiveness.</p>

<p>Does a particular weekday stand out, when looking at breaches and reports? The
following plot attempts to answer this question.</p>

<p><img src="breaches-by-weekday.png" alt="Breaches by weekday" /></p>

<p>While breaches occur rather uniformly across the week, reports tend to focus on
the last workdays of the week. Naturally, we do not see official reports on the
weekend. One explanation for the higher reports near the weekend may be that
incident responders were given a deadline to finish their report out “by the
end of the week.”</p>

<h3 id="leaderboard">Leaderboard</h3>

<p>Which organizations have experience the most breaches?</p>

<p><img src="breaches-top10-most-breached.png" alt="Organizations with the most breaches" /></p>

<p>We can see that American Express leads the game. However, some financial
organizations (American Express, Discover) also <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/breachreport2016">have to report breaches which
occurred at the merchants</a>, so consider the numbers with a grain of
salt. Let’s take the two out in the next plots, which shows the number the
organizations with the most number of reports.</p>

<p><img src="breaches-top10-most-reported.png" alt="Organizations with the most reports" /></p>

<p>The health sector dominates in this ranking, followed by financial service
organization. Clearly, Yolo Federal Credit Union lives up to its name.</p>

<h3 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h3>

<p>Let us take a closer look at the <em>responsiveness</em>: the time from when the data
breach occurred to when the organization reported it. The law requires
reporting individuals “<em>in the most expedient time possible and without
unreasonable delay.</em>”</p>

<p>At first, I found that one entry in the data set has a negative responsiveness,
which did not make sense. How can an organization report a breach before it
occurred? I wrote the Office of the Attorney General an email for
clarification, and it turned out it was typo. They fixed it within a few hours.</p>

<p>The plot below shows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function">empirical cumulative distribution function
(ECDF)</a> of the response time.</p>

<p><img src="breaches-responsiveness-ecdf.png" alt="Response time" /></p>

<p>We observe a median response time of 2 months. The 1st quartile is at 1 month
and the 3rd at 5 months. 10% of all breaches take longer than 1 year and 3%
longer than 2 years. We obviously grapple with <em>advanced persistent threats</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the two ends of this spectrum: the slowest and the fastest
responders.</p>

<p><img src="breaches-responsiveness-worst.png" alt="Slowest responsiveness" />
<img src="breaches-responsiveness-best.png" alt="Fastest responsiveness" /></p>

<p>The first plot shows the slowest responders and the second the fastest. Note
that the first y-axis is in terms of <em>years</em> and the latter in <em>days</em>. If a
company experienced multiple breaches, I took the median of those where the
breach time is available. (In 183 cases, organizations did not know when the
breach occured.) As we see in the first plot, the health sector clearly
exhibits the slowest response time, but the financial sector and universities
follow. The fastest responder was Consolidated Tribal Health Project, Inc.,
with a report going out on the same day as the breach. This particular breach
involved a <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/CTHP%20Exhibits_0.pdf">disgrunteled former employee</a>. Other
than that, no clear market sector pattern stands out.</p>

<p>What happens, when we look at a yearly analysis? Did the industry got any
better over time? The next plot attempts to go deeper into this question, by
grouping the responsiveness by the report year.</p>

<p><img src="breaches-responsiveness-ecdf-by-year.png" alt="Response time by year" /></p>

<p>First, I encourage you to squint a little and do not pay much attention to the
2016 distribution. We have just finished Q1 in this year not yet enough data to
compare this year to the other ones. For 2012 and 2015, we see an <em>increasing</em>
responsiveness. The median responsiveness in 2012 was 43 days, and 83 in 2015.
Almost twice as much! Visually, we see that the blue 2015 line “detaches”
itself from the other three. In fact, the distance roughly corresponds to 50%
in time, e.g., the median responsiveness in 2014 was 55 days, and 83.5 days in
2015, which is an increase of 51%.</p>

<p>What we cannot learn from this data, is the obvious next question: <em>why</em>? Is
this a policy problem? Do we need better workflows in incident response teams?
Or is a technical issue?</p>

<p>My own research strongly focuses on the technical aspect: I am developing
better tools for network forensics at scale with the open-source platform <a href="http://vast.io">VAST
(Visibility Across Space and Time)</a>, which our <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/vallentin">USENIX
NSDI’16 paper</a> describes in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When looking at California breach data from a high-level, we can draw the
following conclusions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We observe a steady amount of data breaches.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organizations from the health and financial sector have experienced the most
number of breaches per institution. (Note: <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/breachreport2016">across organizations</a>,
the retail sector exhibits the largest number of breaches with 25%,
followed by “other” with 19%, finance with 18%, and then health care with
16%.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The responsiveness in incident reporting <em>increases</em> over the years. In 2015,
the median response time was 50% higher than in 2014. The health sector
appears to have the slowest response times.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/breachreport2016">data breach report</a>, which includes more details about sector
distribution, number of records breached, and breach types.</p>
